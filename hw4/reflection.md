Assignment 4

Rose Lin

* The exercise helps me get more familiar with the tagging methods of nltk, and the two tutorials are really helpful.

* The tagging system is designed as follows:

  * Train hmm Tagger on all nltk brown corpus tagged sentences, with category news and tagset as universal, so that the tagged sentences from hmm Tagger would be the golden standard.
  
  * Tag all four texts with Unigram Tagger.
  
  * Use the hmm Tagger to evaluate the outcome of Unigram Tagger.
